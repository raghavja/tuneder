# Tuneder

Tunder is a web application developed by Raghav Jain, Steven Marsh, and Sean Lissner using electron. It uses the Spotify API to preview 30 second snippets of songs to the user and prompts them to either add it to a custom playlist if they like the song, or ignore it and hear the next song if they don't.
